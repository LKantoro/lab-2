# Instructions

**Create a Quarto file for ALL Lab 2 (no separate files for Parts 1 and 2).**

- Make sure your final file is carefully formatted, so that each analysis is
clear and concise.
- Be sure your knitted `.html` file shows **all** your source code, including
any function definitions. 

# Part One: Identifying Bad Visualizations

If you happen to be bored and looking for a sensible chuckle, you should check
out these [Bad Visualisations](https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/). Looking through these is also a good exercise in cataloging what makes a visualization
good or bad. 

## Dissecting a Bad Visualization

Below is an example of a less-than-ideal visualization from the collection
linked above. It comes to us from data provided for the [Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report](https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) by the 
Gallup World Poll:

![](images/bad-wellcome-graph.jpg)

1. While there are certainly issues with this image, do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

- The graph is showing the distribution of vaccine trust across countries of the world. The countries are grouped into global region, such as 'Americas' and 'Asia'. The author is trying to show how vaccine trust differs between regions of the world, and within region of the world.


2. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization. 
*Hint: Variables refer to columns in the data.*

- There are four variables in this visualization. One is the percent of people in each country who trust vaccines. The y-axis variable is based directly off the order of vaccine trust, on the x-axis. The other two variables are country, and global region. 

3. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (e.g., `ggplot`), list the *aesthetics* used and which *variables* are mapped to each.

- The aesthetics used include x, y, and color. 

- Vaccine trust percentage is mapped to x, ranking within each global region is mapped to y.

- The global region is mapped to the color aesthetic within geom_point.

- The country variable is mapped to the label aesthetic.

4. What type of graph would you call this? Meaning, what `geom` would you use
to produce this plot?

- geom_dotplot()

5. Provide at least four problems or changes that would improve this graph. 
*Please format your changes as bullet points!*

- The y-axis is not useful as it is directly based off the x-axis.
- Even though the y-axis is not useful, there is no indication of what it represents.
- The x-axis does not start at 0, which messes up the scale.
- The legend at the bottom does not provide any additional information that is not already in the graph.


## Improving the Bad Visualization

The data for the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be downloaded at the following site: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018](https://wellcome.org/sites/default/files/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx)

<!-- at the "Dataset and crosstabs for all countries" link on the right side of the page-->

There are two worksheets in the downloaded dataset file. You may need to read
them in separately, but you may also just use one if it suffices.

```{r}
#| label: read-in-wellcome-data

wgm2018_crosstab = read_excel(here::here("wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx"), sheet = 1)

wgm2018_full = read_excel(here::here("wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx"), sheet = 2)

wgm2018_dict = read_excel(here::here("wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx"), sheet = 3)
```

6. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you
identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the
same story better.

```{r}
#| label: new-and-improved-visualization


#Q25

#create a new table
#filter on values of 1,2,3,4,5
#find percentage who answered 1
#take mean per country

countriesstringsplit = str_split(wgm2018_dict[1,3], ',')


countriesdf = as.data.frame(countriesstringsplit, col.names = c("country"))

countriesdf = countriesdf %>%
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(145))



countriesdf = countriesdf %>% separate_wider_delim(country, delim = "=", names = c("country_code", "country_name"))


countriesdf = countriesdf %>% mutate(country_code = as.numeric(country_code))
```



```{r}

          regionsdf[['region_code']] %in% c(15,16,17) ~ 'Europe',
          regionsdf[['region_code']] %in% c(3,13) ~ 'Middle East and North Africa',
          regionsdf[['region_code']] == 14 ~ 'Former Soviet Union',
          regionsdf[['region_code']] == 0 ~ 'Not Assigned')

```

```{r}

wgm2018_full_new2 = left_join(wgm2018_full_new, regionsdf, by = join_by(Regions_Report == region_code))

countries_and_regions = distinct(wgm2018_full_new2[61:63])
```

```{r}
country_counts = wgm2018_full_new2 %>% group_by(country_name) %>% summarise(total_count = n()) %>%
  rename('total_surveyed' = total_count)

vaccine_safe_counts = wgm2018_full_new2 %>% 
  group_by(country_name, Q25) %>% summarise(total_count = n()) %>%
  rename('total_safe' = total_count)

vaccine_safe_counts = filter(vaccine_safe_counts, Q25 == '1')

```


```{r}
graph1_tibble = left_join(country_counts, vaccine_safe_counts, by = join_by(country_name == country_name))

graph1_tibble$value = graph1_tibble$total_safe/graph1_tibble$total_surveyed

graph1_tibble2 = left_join(graph1_tibble, countries_and_regions, by = join_by(country_name == country_name))

graph1_tibble2 = graph1_tibble2 %>% filter(map_region != "Not Assigned")
```


```{r}
graph1_tibble2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = map_region, color = map_region)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = .01) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(map_region), axis.labels = "margins") +

       fill = "",
       title = "Percent of People Who Believe Vaccines Are Effective By Country and Region") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +

# Part Two: Broad Visualization Improvement

The full Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be found here: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf](https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf). 
Surprisingly, the visualization above does not appear in the report despite the
citation in the bottom corner of the image!

## Second Data Visualization Improvement

**For this second plot, you must select a plot that uses maps so you can demonstrate your proficiency with the `leaflet` package!**

7. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

- Page 55, Chart 3.3: "Map of countries according to levels of Trust in Scientists"

- Q11C, page 55, level of trust of scientist by country

- The graph is demonstrating how trust in scientists varies throughout the world. Darker shades of green represent higher trust in scientists.

- The authors want the reader to discern what causes the population of certain countries to have higher trust in scientists than others.


8. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.

- There are 2 variables used in this visualization. One variable is country. The other variable is a score on a scale of 1-4, answering the question "How much do you trusts scientists in your country?". The mean score of each country is taken and determines the color of each country on the map.

9. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.

- addTiles for the countries

10. What type of graph would you call this?

- This is a chloropeth map

11. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.  

- The variation in color is not large enough.
- The scale used to measure distrust is not clear based on the graph.
- The subtitle does not clarify what the scale means.

12. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.

```{r}
#| label: second-improved-visualization

#download data, create a tibble, separate_wider
#https://r-graph-gallery.com/183-choropleth-map-with-leaflet.html


download.file(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/R-graph-gallery/master/DATA/world_shape_file.zip",
  destfile = "DATA/world_shape_file.zip"
)

system("unzip DATA/world_shape_file.zip")


world_sf <- read_sf(paste0(
  getwd(), "/DATA/world_shape_file/",
  "TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.shp"
))

world_sf <- world_sf %>%
  mutate(POP2005 = ifelse(POP2005 == 0, NA, round(POP2005 / 1000000, 2)))



# Basic choropleth with leaflet
#m <- leaflet(world_sf) %>%
#  addTiles() %>%
#  setView(lat = 10, lng = 0, zoom = 2) %>%
#  addPolygons(fillColor = ~ mypalette(POP2005), stroke = FALSE)

#m
class(world_sf)

```


```{r}
graph2_df = right_join(graph1_tibble2, world_sf, by = join_by(country_name == NAME))
```

```{r}
bins = c(0, .10, .20, .30, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8, .9)

pal = colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = graph2_df$value, bins = bins)


#converting data.frame to sf: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html
graph2_df = st_sf(graph2_df)


leaflet(graph2_df) %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(value), weight = 2, opacity = 1, color = 'black')

```



## Third Data Visualization Improvement

**For this third plot, you must use one of the other `ggplot2` extension packages mentioned this week (e.g., `gganimate`, `plotly`, `patchwork`, `cowplot`).**
 
13. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

- page 112, Q25,26, Chart 5.4: "Scatterplot exploring people’s perceptions of vaccine safety and vaccine effectiveness"

- The graph is telling us that countries with higher distrust of vaccines tend to also believe that they are not effective. The authors included a line of best fit to demonstrate the positive trend between lack of vaccine trust and lack of a belief in vaccine effectiveness.

14. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.

- The variables used in this visualization are country, the percentage of people in each country who believe vaccines are not safe, and the percentage of people in each country who think vaccines are not effective.

15. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.

- plotly

16. What type of graph would you call this?

- This is a scatter plot.

17. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.  

- The legend is unnecessary
- The y-axis label makes viewers tilt their head
- Colors would provide additional information, such as (population or region)
- x-axis title is in the bottom right
- The type of graph is in the title of the graph, which is redundant
- Gridlines are too frequent

18. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.

```{r}
#| label: third-improved-visualization


wgm2018_full_new2



vaccine_effective_counts = wgm2018_full_new2 %>% group_by(country_name, map_region, Q26) %>% summarise(total_count = n()) %>% rename('total_effective'= total_count)

vaccine_effective_counts = filter(vaccine_effective_counts, Q26 == 1)

vaccine_effective_counts
```

```{r}
percent_effective = inner_join(country_counts, vaccine_effective_counts, by = join_by(country_name == country_name))


percent_effective_and_safe = full_join(percent_effective, vaccine_safe_counts, by = join_by(country_name == country_name))

percent_effective_and_safe$perc_safe = percent_effective_and_safe$total_safe/percent_effective_and_safe$total_surveyed * 100

percent_effective_and_safe$perc_effective = percent_effective_and_safe$total_effective/percent_effective_and_safe$total_surveyed * 100


percent_effective_and_safe = percent_effective_and_safe %>% 
  mutate(perc_safe = round(perc_safe, 2), perc_effective = round(perc_effective, 2))

```

```{r}
#scales package for percentage label



best_fit_line <- lm(perc_effective ~ perc_safe, data = percent_effective_and_safe)



fig = plot_ly(data = percent_effective_and_safe, x = ~perc_safe, y = ~perc_effective,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", text = ~country_name, color = ~map_region) %>%
  layout(plot_bgcolor='white',
    xaxis = list(ticksuffix = "%", range = list(0, 100), title = "Believe Vaccines are Safe"),
    yaxis = list(ticksuffix="%", range = list(0, 100), title = ""),
    title = "Belief in Vaccine Effectiveness Versus Belief in Vaccine Safety in Different Countries")
  

fig


#color by world region, subtitle

```
